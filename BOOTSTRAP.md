# BOOTSTRAP — a new chatbot product from this baseline, in one landing

How to go from **nothing** to **a chatbot live on stage and prod — its own
Supabase project per environment, Hyperdrive in front of it, an R2 bucket for
attachments, the schema applied, the app deployed and chatting on Workers AI
— documented**, with two provider consents and no model key.

There is one artifact: **`repo-blueprint.yaml`**. It declares what to place,
in what order, what each phase needs first, and what to say while it runs.
`orun new` is the whole runtime — the phases below are its `--phase` names,
not separate workflows. The console card the platform renders is
**`blueprint.yaml`**; it names the build document and states the inputs, the
brokered secrets and the programme, and `testing/manifest.test.sh` holds it
to what the build document does.

Target wall-clock: **about twenty minutes** — an estimate summed from the
phases until a bootstrap measures it: one landing, then one convergence per
environment (stage and prod side by side until `02-docs` restores the
promotion gate) that creates the Supabase project (five to seven minutes),
the Hyperdrive config and the R2 bucket, applies the migrations and builds
and deploys the app, infra before app.

## 0. What you need

- GitHub org access (repository creation) and a machine with `git`, `node`
  (≥ 22), `pnpm` (10.12.1), `python3` with PyYAML, `curl`, and the `orun`
  CLI **≥ v2.58.11** — the floor for RUNNING the bootstrap (the phase overlay,
  landings that wait on the PR's whole CI run, `githubOwner` on the doctor
  probe, `environments` on the secrets probe, `from: workspace`). The
  product's own `ci.yml` pins its lanes separately (v2.78.4), and that pin is
  what reads the per-edge `mode` rules the convergence order relies on.
- A **Cloudflare** account (the free plan is enough for one Worker with
  static assets, Hyperdrive, an R2 bucket and Workers AI's free daily
  allocation) and its Account API token with the permission groups the
  console's Connect recipe lists — Workers Scripts, Hyperdrive and R2 among
  them. Workers AI needs no token: the Worker's `AI` binding runs on the
  account it deploys to.
- A **Supabase** organization the platform can create projects in, connected
  to the workspace (console → Integrations → Supabase), **with room for two
  projects**: the build creates one for stage and one for prod, and
  Supabase's free plan allows exactly two active projects per organization.
  An organization that already has one or two active projects needs to pause
  them, or a paid plan.
- An Orun Cloud workspace for the product — `orunWorkspace`, or the workspace
  the build runs in (ORUN_WORKSPACE) when that is unset — with an
  **admin-role API key** for headless runs (secret writes below admin are
  masked as `not_found`).
- **The repository allow-listed in the workspace** (console → Settings → Git
  repos), unless the credential can write links. `01-product`'s `link` step
  stops and names the fix if it is not.
- **No AI vendor key.** No platform brokers one: the chat runs on Workers AI,
  and the Vercel AI Gateway's models are an optional key the owner adds
  afterwards (§3).
- **A known platform risk (R2).** The R2 bucket is applied with its own
  `r2-data` key, but the Worker's `BLOB` binding is attached by the deploy,
  which runs with the `workers-deploy` token (Workers Scripts and KV).
  Whether that token may bind R2 is unproven live; if the first deploy fails
  on it, the fix is the platform's `workers-deploy` template.

## 1. One command: `--resume`

The whole bootstrap, unattended. `--resume` places every phase not already
derived as done, in order, honouring each phase's barrier:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 --branch <baseline-tag> https://github.com/sourceplane/ai-chatbot
cd ai-chatbot

orun new --blueprint repo-blueprint.yaml \
  --out ~/products/acme-chat --run-hooks --resume \
  --set reponame=acme-chat --set productname="Acme Chat" \
  --set productdomain=acme.dev --set githuborg=acme-inc \
  --set orunWorkspace=ws_XXXXXXXX \
  --set subdomain=<workers-dev-subdomain>
```

`subdomain` is the workers.dev subdomain of the Cloudflare account you deploy
into (Workers & Pages → your subdomain). A build started from the console, or
with `orun baseline new --from bst_…`, never asks for it: the platform reads
it from the workspace's Cloudflare connection, the same one the deploy tokens
mint from. Only a hand-run build like this one passes it.

**`--run-hooks` is the difference between placing files and bootstrapping a
product.** Without it `orun new` writes the tree and stops: no repository, no
landing, no convergence watch, no probe. That is deliberate — it is what
makes the offline bootstrap in `testing/` possible with no workspace and no
provider.

`--resume` is safe to re-run from anywhere, a fresh container with a fresh
`--out` included: **phase state is derived from the tree, never stored.** A
phase whose files are present but branded derives as `drifted`, and
`--resume` leaves it placed rather than reverting the product's identity.

## 1b. Or phase by phase

| phase | what it lands | verified by |
|---|---|---|
| `01-product` | the repository, created and linked; the six brokered credentials; then the whole product in one PR — intent, CI, tooling, identity, the Supabase, Hyperdrive and R2 Terraform roots, the migrations, the app and its tests | the convergence green (supabase → cloudflare-hyperdrive → db-migrate → web, and cloudflare-r2 → web, per environment), the five published secrets on stage and prod, `/ping` and `/api/health` answering on both workers.dev URLs |
| `02-docs` | `ai/context/deployment.md` from probed facts (which model provider serves included); prod's promotion gate and dev's push lanes restored | the final probe |

```bash
orun new --blueprint repo-blueprint.yaml --out ~/products/acme-chat --run-hooks \
  --phase 01-product --values ~/acme-chat.values.yaml
# … then 02-docs
```

`02-docs` reads the identity back from `.rebrand/values.json` in the placed
tree, but the blueprint's **required** inputs — `reponame`, `productname`,
`productdomain`, `githuborg` — are validated before anything runs, so pass
them every time (a `--values` file is easier). The full guide, one page per
phase: [docs/phases/README.md](docs/phases/README.md).

| flag | what it does |
|---|---|
| `--status` | derives and prints every phase's state and writes nothing. It parses the document, validates each hook against the action registry and compiles every template; it needs no credential and no network |
| `--phase <name>` | places exactly that phase; its `requires.phases` still gates |
| `--until <name>` | places every phase through that one and stops |

What lands in the product is PRODUCT-ONLY: the app, the Terraform roots, the
migrations and their runner, the tests, its CI, its tooling, its README and
its two context pages. None of this repository's machinery (`.baseline/`, the
blueprints, `tooling/rebrand`, `tooling/bootstrap`, `hooks/`, `testing/`,
`docs/phases/`, `specs/`, `tasks/`, this file) ships, and no shipped file
names any of it. That promise is a test: `testing/leak.test.sh` derives what
every phase would place and gates the set and every file's text, and
`testing/placement.test.sh` gates the same rules over a placed, branded tree.

## 2. Headless / container mode

The blueprint's source is this repository (`sources: [{kind: dir, path: .}]`),
so the container contract is a shallow clone at a pinned tag plus two
tokens:

```bash
export ORUN_TOKEN=…          # orun auth, headless
export GITHUB_TOKEN=…        # fine-grained PAT (below)

git clone --depth 1 --branch <baseline-tag> https://github.com/sourceplane/ai-chatbot
cd ai-chatbot
orun new --blueprint repo-blueprint.yaml \
  --out /work/acme-chat --run-hooks --resume --progress json \
  --values /work/acme-chat.values.yaml
```

| requirement | detail |
|---|---|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | fine-grained PAT: **read** on this repository; on the PRODUCT's repository **contents write**, **pull-requests write**, **actions read+write** (`orun.run/watch@v1` resumes runs with `gh run rerun`), **checks read**; **repository create** on the owner if `01-product` creates it (or pre-create it — supported) |
| classic token caveat | a classic PAT or gh OAuth token also needs the `workflow` scope to push `.github/workflows/` |
| pinning | the clone's `--branch <tag>` pins everything: the blueprint, its modules and its hooks' scripts all come from that one commit |

## 3. After the product is live

- **The models** need nothing: the chat, the titles and the artifact tools
  run on Workers AI through the Worker's `AI` binding, billed to the
  Cloudflare account. To add the Vercel AI Gateway's models (upstream's
  list), set its key per environment:

  ```bash
  wrangler secret put AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY --name <reponame>-web-<env>
  ```

  Without it the picker offers only the Workers AI models. The product's
  README, "Models", is the owner's copy of this.
- **The session key** needs nothing: the database generated one per
  environment when the migrations first ran. `AUTH_SECRET` as a Worker secret
  overrides it (and ends every session).
- **Redis** is optional: `REDIS_URL` as a Worker secret turns on resumable
  streams and the IP rate limit. Without it the per-user hourly limit still
  applies.
- **Custom domain**: attach it to the Worker in Cloudflare, then set
  `SITE_URL` under the environment's `env:` in the product's `intent.yaml`
  (its README, "Custom domain"). There is no domain phase: attaching a domain needs zone
  permissions the brokered `workers-deploy` token does not carry.
- **Refresh the record**: re-run `--phase 02-docs`; it is idempotent, and it
  records which model provider serves.

## 4. Testing this baseline

`.github/workflows/baseline.yml` runs three tiers on every pull request, and
each runs locally the same way:

```bash
for t in manifest phases coverage rebrand retouch bootstrap-defer wire; do bash testing/$t.test.sh; done
bash testing/leak.test.sh        # needs orun
bash testing/placement.test.sh   # needs orun, node, pnpm: the offline bootstrap and the product's own plans
bash testing/e2e.test.sh         # + network for pnpm, psql and a PostgreSQL server install
```

The offline bootstrap (`testing/lib/bootstrap.sh`) places both phases in
order and finishes each with the blueprint's OWN `run:` hooks — read out of
`repo-blueprint.yaml`, not transcribed — so the retouch marker, the rebrand,
the re-tenant, the deferrals and their restore, the lockfile and the
deployment record all run exactly as a real bootstrap runs them. Only the
platform's typed actions (task, repo, reconcile, land, watch, secrets,
probe) and the `link` step are stood in for, a landing becoming a commit.

What no test here can do is the clouds' half: create a Supabase project,
apply the Hyperdrive config and the bucket, mint a token, deploy for real —
or call Workers AI. The Terraform roots are held to `init -backend=false` and
`validate` (a real `plan` reads Supabase's and Cloudflare's APIs and the
platform's state backend); the convergence ORDER is proven on the product's
own `orun plan`; the migrations are applied by the product's own runner to a
local Postgres through a stand-in for the one Supabase Management API
endpoint it calls (`testing/lib/fake-supabase-api.py`); and the built Worker
then serves a guest over that database and wrangler's local R2, its `AI`
binding pointed at a deterministic stand-in (`testing/lib/fake-ai/`) that
streams a canned answer the way Workers AI's binding does. That a real
Workers AI model answers, calls tools and honours structured output is
verified only by a live deployment.

## 5. Cutting a baseline tag (maintainers)

Every product built from this repository resolves a `baseline-vN` tag, so the
tag is cut by a workflow rather than by hand:

```bash
gh workflow run tag.yml -f version=baseline-v1          # from main
gh workflow run tag.yml -f version=baseline-v1 -f ref=<sha>
```

It refuses a version that is not `baseline-v<N>` and a tag that already
exists: a baseline tag is never moved. Then add (or move) the registry row in
orun-cloud's `infra/baselines-registry/baselines.yaml` by pull request —
after the tag exists, because the registry's sync fetches `blueprint.yaml`
at the tag and refuses the whole catalogue if it 404s.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause → fix |
|---|---|
| `01-product` parks: `waiting for github for <org>` | the workspace's GitHub connection is to another account. Connect the App installation on `<org>` (console → Integrations → GitHub), then `--resume` |
| `01-product` parks on the `providers` probe for cloudflare or supabase | that connection is missing. Connect it (console → Integrations); the probe is a wait, not a failure |
| `01-product` stops at `link` | the repository is not linked to the workspace and the credential cannot link it. Allow-list it (console → Settings → Git repos) and re-run the phase |
| Secret WRITE fails `not_found` while listings work | the API key's role is below admin; re-mint it with the admin role |
| supabase apply: `does not support oauth access` | a supabase provider ≥ 1.6 reads billing endpoints the brokered OAuth token cannot; the root pins `~> 1.5.1` — keep it |
| supabase apply: project limit reached | the Supabase org already has active projects; the free plan allows two, and stage + prod need both. Pause or delete one, or upgrade, then re-run `01-product` |
| hyperdrive apply: Authentication error (10000) | the Hyperdrive token lacks the permission; reconnect Cloudflare with the recipe's permission groups and re-run the phase — the reconcile re-mints only what is missing |
| r2 apply: Authentication error (10000) | the R2 token (`r2-data`) lacks the permission; reconnect Cloudflare with R2 in the recipe and re-run the phase |
| web deploy fails naming R2 or the bucket | the open risk in §0: the `workers-deploy` token could not attach the `BLOB` binding. A platform fix (the template's scopes), not a change to the product |
| the chat answers "Workers AI could not answer with …" | Workers AI refused the request: a model it no longer serves (pick another in `apps/web/lib/ai/models.ts`), or the account's Workers AI allocation spent |
| hyperdrive or db-migrate: `secret resolution failed … SUPABASE_*` | the supabase apply for that environment did not publish; its lane's log says why. Both wait on it, enforced |
| db-migrate: `row-level security would lock the app out of …` | migration 030 refused: `postgres` (Hyperdrive's role) neither owns the tables in `public` nor bypasses RLS. Nothing was enabled; give `postgres` the tables or BYPASSRLS and re-run `01-product` |
| web smoke: `/api/health` 503 | `database: unreachable` — the Hyperdrive config is wrong or the project is paused; `schema: missing` — db-migrate did not run for that environment |
| `build-app` fails: `Symlink apps/web/node_modules/next is invalid, it points out of the filesystem root` | the product's intent pins stack-tectonic ≥ 0.20.0, whose lane-scoped install links each job's node_modules out of its tree, which Next 16's Turbopack refuses. Pin 0.19.0 (`intent.yaml` says why) |
| `verify-app-structure` fails: `test -f "wrangler.jsonc"` | the product's `apps/web/wrangler.jsonc` is not committed. It must be — the check runs before the build in a fresh checkout (`pnpm run wire:fixture` renders it) |
| Convergence failed AFTER the PR merged; re-running lands nothing | expected on its own — the files are on main. Re-run the phase (`--phase 01-product`, `--redo 01-product`, or the console's Retry): its `retouch` hook gives the landing a diff and the components re-plan; the project and the config are adopted, not recreated |
| The convergence reported green, then `verify` got 404 | a second workflow ran on the push to main and the watch took its run. Only `ci.yml` may run on a push to main; `checks.yml` runs on pull requests only |
| The product's `intent.yaml` says `workspace: ws_SET_ME` | `orunWorkspace` was empty and the build ran outside a workspace; set it and re-run `01-product` |
| A bootstrap stopped before `02-docs`; prod no longer waits on stage | the gate is deferred, not dropped: run `02-docs`, or `node tooling/bootstrap/promotion.mjs --restore --file <product>/intent.yaml` |
| `✕ input "productdomain" is required` | all four required inputs must be set on every invocation, single-phase ones included |
| `unknown flag: --phase` or a parse error in the blueprint | the CLI is below the v2.58.11 floor |
