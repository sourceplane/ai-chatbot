-- Row-level security on every table in `public`, and no policies.
--
-- Supabase's Data API (PostgREST) serves `public` to anyone holding the
-- project's anon key, which is public by Supabase's design. Upstream assumed
-- a private Postgres, so its tables — "User" with its password hashes, every
-- chat and message — had no RLS, and the Data API would hand them out. With
-- RLS enabled and no policy, `anon` and `authenticated` read and write
-- NOTHING through it. The app is not affected: it connects through Hyperdrive
-- as `postgres` (the cloudflare-hyperdrive root's database_user), which
-- created and owns these tables, and a table's owner is not subject to its
-- RLS unless FORCE is set (it is not). The migration ledgers (`_migrations`,
-- drizzle-kit's `drizzle`) and `app_private` are schemas the Data API does
-- not expose.
--
-- apps/web/lib/db/schema.ts declares `.enableRLS()` on each table (its
-- drizzle-kit twin is apps/web/lib/db/migrations/0002_row_level_security.sql);
-- tests/db fails if any table in `public` is left without RLS after the
-- migrations.
--
-- FIRST, the guard. If `postgres` neither owns every table here nor has
-- SUPERUSER or BYPASSRLS, enabling RLS would lock the app out of its own
-- data: stop. The guard changes nothing and runs before the first ALTER, so
-- a refusal enables nothing. Idempotent: ENABLE on an enabled table is a
-- no-op.
